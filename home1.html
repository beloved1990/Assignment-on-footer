        <p>I am dedicated and ever ready to learn young man, <br>
            i so much believe that i can achieve anything i set my heart to do.</p></div>
            My journey in life has taught me diverse lessons such that it is until i laydown my sword i will stop learning
            That is my story about going back to learnig software development,<br> this is what i have rejected in time past
            that i can not do simply because i was thinking it is time consuming, it wont let me have time of myself.
            Alas it wasnt so, because i later realize that even the simplest of Job can also be tiring provided one is not committed to it.
            therefore, i cant afford to chicken out of what i know that it can build name for me, impact younger generation and so on.
